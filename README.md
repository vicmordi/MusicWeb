VickTunez is a sleek and dynamic music web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a curated collection of popular Afrobeats artists, displaying their images and names in a clean, responsive layout. Each artist card redirects users to their official YouTube channel or music video, providing instant access to their latest hits. This project highlights interactive UI elements and smooth navigation, offering users a simple way to explore Afrobeats music directly from the web.
